						<p>Participating in the Honors First Year Research Project on sustainable fashion opened my eyes to the pressing environmental issues within the textile industry, 
                            specifically the harmful effects of textile dyeing. Through this project, I conducted in-depth research on pollution metrics, such as water usage, chemical waste,
                             and energy consumption, which are significantly impacted by traditional dyeing processes. I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, collecting and interpreting 
                             environmental data to quantify these effects and develop potential solutions. This experience deepened my understanding of sustainability and its practical implications, 
                             teaching me how data-driven insights can guide more eco-friendly practices. My research culminated in exploring natural dye alternatives and proposing optimized dyeing techniques 
                             that reduce environmental impact. This project not only enhanced my analytical and problem-solving skills but also fueled my commitment to advancing sustainable practices within the 
                             fashion industry.</p>
